# MCU-Based Mango Fruit Leather Machine

This study introduces the MCU-Based Mango Fruit Leather Machine, designed to streamline the production process of mango fruit leather, reducing manual labor and ensuring consistent output. Mangoes, especially the Indian variety known as Katchamita, are economically vital in the Philippines but face significant wastage due to overproduction and short shelf life. The proposed machine automates the key stages of production, including ingredient dispensing, mixing, and dehydration, with the aim of utilizing surplus mangoes effectively. Evaluations based on functional suitability, performance efficiency, reliability, and maintainability provided valuable insights for optimizing these processes.

## Recommendations
The MCU-Based Mango Fruit Leather Machine is designed to help mango farmers in Pila, Laguna, effectively utilize excess mangoes that would otherwise go to waste. This utilization of the machine supports better resource management and contributes to the sustainability of local agriculture, providing a practical solution to the problem of excess fruit during peak harvest seasons. To enhance the performance and effectiveness of the MCU-Based Mango Fruit Leather Machine, several improvements have been recommended. Based on thorough testing and evaluation by the researchers, the following recommendations have been proposed to enhance the machine's performance and effectiveness.
1. For the dispenser, it is recommended to use a solenoid valve or a post-mix dispensing system to achieve more precise control over the dispensing of raw materials.
2. For the mixer, instead of relying solely on mixing, it is suggested to incorporate a filtering system or implement blending functionality into the machine's design.
3. For the dehydrator, include an exhaust system to manage excess heat and moisture. Additionally, optimize the placement of the heating element and fan to ensure even distribution of heat.
